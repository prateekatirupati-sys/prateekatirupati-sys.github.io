## 🎯 The Easiest Way to Get Started

### 1️⃣ See It Live (Right Now)
The development server is already running! 
- Open: **`http://localhost:19006`**
- You'll see your app in the browser with hot-reload enabled

### 2️⃣ Test on Your Phone
While the dev server is running:
1. Open Command Prompt and type: `ipconfig`
2. Look for "IPv4 Address" (e.g., `192.168.1.100`)
3. On your phone, visit: `http://192.168.1.100:19006`
4. Done! Your app works on mobile

### 3️⃣ Build for Production (When Ready)
```bash
build-web.bat  # Windows
./build-web.sh # Mac/Linux
```

This creates a `dist` folder with your website ready to deploy.

## ❓ FAQs

**Q: Do I need both a mobile app AND website?**

**Q: Can I add backend APIs?**
A: Yes! Just update the API URLs in your config.

**Q: How often can I update?**
A: Website: instant. Mobile apps: requires app store review (1-3 days).
